What the hell is going on here, where is this?
To be honest, I feel that the work of the students here is really good.
The atmosphere，I can feel it- as if it is a part of me. I remember how we all loved videogames. 
Since graduating, gaming has been a pure source of passion for me, which is actually really painful..
I feel like I always comparing myself and the quality of my work with everyone else constantly
It makes me question the meaning of what I'm doing..why I am doing what I am doing
Making games is a very difficult thing for me right now, and I feel very frustrated
I keep doubting that I am a person who is not capable enough
And the work! What takes me forever to do, my classmates could do it in the blink of an eye with finesse!
I don't know what I was thinking
Because it's just so damn lonely to do indie games by yourself it becomes so hard to find motivation
I just feel like I might not really have the talent to make games
Maybe
It’s time…to give up...
