What the hell is going on here, where is this?
Do I need to just keep going like this? This whole tunnel is like a walking simulator

Actually, I love the atmosphere of Game Center, it reminds me of the time when I still loved making games
All the students' works here, as well as the various puzzles designed by this W.S , 
although they are not perfectly made, they all make me feel making games is a happy thing
I don't know when I stopped making games.
I used to study here, but ever since I graduated, life has become extremely stressful.
It's like I've always wanted to use the game to gain the recognition and respect of others.
And I've started to doubt myself more and more, I always feel I'm not doing well enough, 
and I always care about what others opinion, which makes me feel very difficult to move forward.
I feel like my whole life, I've been trying to find answers,but there's no answer for me, 
I'm just a person who thinks I like games but doesn't really like them that much.
I'm a half-assed loser.
That’s me.
