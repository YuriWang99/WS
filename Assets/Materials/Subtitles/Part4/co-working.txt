When I used to go to school, I could always see my classmates here
It looked like a vibrant place and I really liked it there
Oh, this is where I used to sit in class.

Who are you W.S?  And why are you hiding from me?
Did he..design all these games? Why did he make them? And why am I here?

To be honest, I find all this stuff very interesting, like a kid in an amusement park trying all sorts of rides. So many different designs of games- I really envy them! I often feel that I don't have the talent to do such things.
