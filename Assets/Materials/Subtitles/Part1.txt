My name is Luke. I graduated three years ago, now I'm developing my own independent game.
In fact, I'm not working on the game anymore, and I'm now finding that opening a restaurant might make me more money.
However, a guy named W.S. emailed me and asked me to see Game Center today.
I didn't know this guy, but I came over anyway.
I haven't been to Game Center for a long time, and actually I've been out of the game industry also for a long time.
But no matter what, who knows what will happen
