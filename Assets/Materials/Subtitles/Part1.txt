My name is Luke. I graduated three years ago, now I'm developing my own independent game. 
A few days ago someone who goes by the initials of  W.S. sent me an email, 
inviting me to come back after graduation, he said he was waiting for me at Eric's office.
I haven't been to Game Center for a long time, and since I started making games, 
I feel like I don’t have time to do anything.
